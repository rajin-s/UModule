> This is the landing page for the **UModule** collection of extensible framework modules for Unity (2018 or newer)!
> The modules are meant to provide core functionality used in a wide variety of Unity projects, and are designed to integrate painlessly with an existing codebase.

> Each module can be found in its own repository and added to existing projects as a git submodule, or downloaded and extracted manually. If setup as a submodule, new updates can be pulled using `git submodule update --remote`.
